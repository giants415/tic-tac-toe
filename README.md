## Andrew's Tic-Tac-Toe Lab

#####This project was completed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript/jQuery. 

######The goal of this project was to create a tic-tac-toe game that will declare a winner, announce a draw, and keep track of the score between the two sides.

###Future Improvements

Going forward, more improvements will be made to this game. 

In order of importance: 

1) Announce a draw

2) Keep track of the score between the two opponents. 

3) Replace the default X's and O's with different images.
